## Project summary
In this project, out of seven proposed distinct datasets (_apt_buildings_, _building_permits_, _cancer_sample_, _flow_sample_, _parking_meters_, _steam_games_, _vancouver_trees_), I worked with four datasets, conducting comprehensive attribute analysis to gain a deeper understanding of their contents. After careful examination, I chose to focus my attention on the [_**Cancer_sample**_ dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic). This particular dataset contains a sample of quantitative features derived from images of nuclei found in fine needle aspiration biopsies of breast masses from patients treated at [the University of Wisconsin Hospital](https://www.uwhealth.org/).

To gain valuable insights and visualize the data effectively, I utilized various R packages for data manipulation and plot generation. Our goal was to explore the inherent patterns and relationships within the _Cancer_sample_ dataset, with the ultimate aim of extracting meaningful information for further analysis and interpretation.

Finally, I have formulated four questions for the next chapter of the project, 'Mini Data Analysis Project: Milestone 2.
