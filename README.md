## Project summary
Milestones 1
In this project, out of seven proposed distinct datasets (_apt_buildings_, _building_permits_, _cancer_sample_, _flow_sample_, _parking_meters_, _steam_games_, _vancouver_trees_), I worked with four datasets, conducting comprehensive attribute analysis to gain a deeper understanding of their contents. After careful examination, I chose to focus my attention on the [_**Cancer_sample**_ dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic). This particular dataset contains a sample of quantitative features derived from images of nuclei found in fine needle aspiration biopsies of breast masses from patients treated at [the University of Wisconsin Hospital](https://www.uwhealth.org/).

To gain valuable insights and visualize the data effectively, I utilized various R packages for data manipulation and plot generation. My goal was to explore the patterns and relationships within the _Cancer_sample_ dataset, with the ultimate aim of extracting meaningful information for further analysis and interpretation.

Finally, I have formulated four questions for the next chapter of the project, Mini Data Analysis Project: Milestone 2.

Milestones 2
The Mini Data Analysis Project Milestone 2 is about analyzing four selected questions in Milestone 1: for each question, a summarizing and a graphing have been done to address the answer of these questions, you can find the plots of these analyses in a folder called "mini-project-2_files/figure-gfm". Then, check the tidy of the dataset(cancer_sample) based on the first 8 variables. Next, the fitting and modeling have been done for this milestone. Finally, subdatasets which already been generated have been stored in a folder called Output.

## Contents of the Repository
* **README.md:** which provides a brief description of the repo.
* **mini-project1 and 2.Rmd:** which is the mini-project1 and 2 on the Rmarkdown.
* **mini-project1 and 2.md:** which is the markdown output of the mini-project1 and 2.

## Software Required
In order to reproduce the work done in this project, the following software is required:
1. R
2. R-Studio

**Note**: In order to run mini-project1.Rmd you would need Rstudio as well as the tidyverse, datateachr, broom, here and ggplot2 packages installed.
