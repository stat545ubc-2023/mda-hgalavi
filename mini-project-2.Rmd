title: "Mini Data Analysis Milestone 2"
output: github_document
---

*To complete this milestone, you can either edit [this `.rmd` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/master/content/mini-project/mini-project-2.Rmd) directly. Fill in the sections that are commented out with `<!--- start your work here--->`. When you are done, make sure to knit to an `.md` file by changing the output in the YAML header to `github_document`, before submitting a tagged release on canvas.*

# Welcome to the rest of your mini data analysis project!

In Milestone 1, you explored your data. and came up with research questions. This time, we will finish up our mini data analysis and obtain results for your data by: 

- Making summary tables and graphs 
- Manipulating special data types in R: factors and/or dates and times.
-   Fitting a model object to your data, and extract a result.
-   Reading and writing data as separate files.

We will also explore more in depth the concept of *tidy data.* 

**NOTE**: The main purpose of the mini data analysis is to integrate what you learn in class in an analysis. Although each milestone provides a framework for you to conduct your analysis, it's possible that you might find the instructions too rigid for your data set. If this is the case, you may deviate from the instructions -- just make sure you're demonstrating a wide range of tools and techniques taught in this class.

# Instructions

**To complete this milestone**, edit [this very `.Rmd` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/master/content/mini-project/mini-project-2.Rmd) directly. Fill in the sections that are tagged with `<!--- start your work here--->`.

**To submit this milestone**, make sure to knit this `.Rmd` file to an `.md` file by changing the YAML output settings from `output: html_document` to `output: github_document`. Commit and push all of your work to your mini-analysis GitHub repository, and tag a release on GitHub. Then, submit a link to your tagged release on canvas.

**Points**: This milestone is worth 50 points: 45 for your analysis, and 5 for overall reproducibility, cleanliness, and coherence of the Github submission. 

**Research Questions**: In Milestone 1, you chose two research questions to focus on. Wherever realistic, your work in this milestone should relate to these research questions whenever we ask for justification behind your work. In the case that some tasks in this milestone don't align well with one of your research questions, feel free to discuss your results in the context of a different research question.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this milestone, you should:

-   Understand what *tidy* data is, and how to create it using `tidyr`.
-   Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown.
-   Manipulating special data types in R: factors and/or dates and times.
-   Fitting a model object to your data, and extract a result.
-   Reading and writing data as separate files.

# Setup

Begin by loading your data and the tidyverse package below:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(datateachr) # <- might contain the data you picked!
library(tidyverse)
```

# Task 1: Process and summarize your data 

From milestone 1, you should have an idea of the basic structure of your dataset (e.g. number of rows and columns, class types, etc.). Here, we will start investigating your data more in-depth using various data manipulation functions. 

### 1.1 (1 point) 

First, write out the 4 research questions you defined in milestone 1 were. This will guide your work through milestone 2:

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->
##### My questions are:
> Question 1. Does the mean compactness of nuclei present in a sample
> image differ between malignant diagnosis samples and benign diagnosis
> samples?

> Question 2. Is there a difference in the mean perimeter of nuclei
> present in a sample image between malignant diagnosis samples and
> benign diagnosis samples?

> Question 3. Do malignant samples have the largest perimeter of nuclei
> present in the sample image compared to the benign samples?

> Question 4. In malignant samples, is there any association between the
> largest compactness of nuclei and the largest smoothness of nuclei?
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Here, we will investigate your data using various data manipulation and graphing functions.

### 1.2 (8 points)

Now, for each of your four research questions, choose one task from options 1-4 (summarizing), and one other task from 4-8 (graphing). You should have 2 tasks done for each research question (8 total). Make sure it makes sense to do them! (e.g. don't use a numerical variables for a task that needs a categorical variable.). Comment on why each task helps (or doesn't!) answer the corresponding research question.

Ensure that the output of each operation is printed!

Also make sure that you're using dplyr and ggplot2 rather than base R. Outside of this project, you may find that you prefer using base R functions for certain tasks, and that's just fine! But part of this project is for you to practice the tools we learned in class, which is dplyr and ggplot2.

**Summarizing:**

1.  Compute the *range*, *mean*, and *two other summary statistics* of **one numerical variable** across the groups of **one categorical variable** from your data.
2.  Compute the number of observations for at least one of your categorical variables. Do not use the function `table()`!
3.  Create a categorical variable with 3 or more groups from an existing numerical variable. You can use this new variable in the other tasks! *An example: age in years into "child, teen, adult, senior".*
4. Compute the proportion and counts in each category of one categorical variable across the groups of another categorical variable from your data. Do not use the function `table()`!

**Graphing:**

6. Create a graph of your choosing, make one of the axes logarithmic, and format the axes labels so that they are "pretty" or easier to read.
7. Make a graph where it makes sense to customize the alpha transparency.

Using variables and/or tables you made in one of the "Summarizing" tasks: 

8. Create a graph that has at least two geom layers. 
9. Create 3 histograms, with each histogram having different sized bins. Pick the "best" one and explain why it is the best.

Make sure it's clear what research question you are doing each operation for!

<!------------------------- Start your work below ----------------------------->
##### Question 1. Does the **mean compactness** of nuclei present in a sample image differ between _malignant diagnosis_ samples and _benign diagnosis_ samples? 
**Q1.Summarizing:** Compute the *range*, *mean*, and *two other summary statistics* of **one numerical variable** across the groups of **one categorical variable** from your data.

dataset

#plot : this analysis help us to have better idea to see the compactness_mean_se difference between malignant and benign samples.
plot_Q1 <- ggplot(dataset, aes(x = diagnosis, y = compactness_mean_se, color = diagnosis)) +

##### Question 2. Is there a difference in the **mean perimeter** of nuclei present in a sample image between _malignant_ diagnosis samples and _benign_ diagnosis samples?
**Q2.Summarizing:** Compute the *range*, *mean*, and *two other summary statistics* of **one numerical variable** across the groups of **one categorical variable** from your data.
```{r}

# Selected only Benign diagnosis as a categorical variable and compute range,mean, standard deviation, and median of perimeter_mean_se: gives me better idea to compare this variable between malignant and benign specimens.
Benign <- dataset %>%

print(median_perimeter_mean_se)
```
**Q2. Graphing:** Make a graph where it makes sense to customize the alpha transparency.
```{r}
#Loadding the package
library(ggplot2)
dataset

#plot: this analysis help us to have better idea to see the perimeter_mean_se difference between malignant and benign samples.
plot_Q2 <- ggplot(dataset, aes(x = diagnosis, y = perimeter_mean_se, color = diagnosis)) +

  labs(
    title = "Perimeter (Mean + SE) by Diagnosis",
    x = "Diagnosis",
    y = "Perimeter (Mean + SE) of nuclei"
  )+
  theme_minimal()
print(plot_Q2)
```

##### Question 3. Do _malignant samples_ have the **largest perimeter** of nuclei present in the sample image compared to the _benign_ samples?
**Q3.Summarizing:** Compute the *range*, *mean*, and *two other summary statistics* of **one numerical variable** across the groups of **one categorical variable** from your data.
```{r}

#Producing a new dataset only contain perimeter data called perimeter_dataset from malignant dataset: only have the variable for malignant patients.
perimeter_Malignant <- Malignant %>%  
  select(diagnosis, perimeter_mean, perimeter_se, perimeter_mean_se, perimeter_worst)
print(perimeter_Malignant)

# based on the description of the main datasheet(cancer_sample), perimeter_worst is "Worst" or largest perimeter of nuclei present in sample image. so for answering the question number 3, I should consider perimeter_worst variable as the largest perimeter of nuclei present in the sample image.
  
#range of perimeter_worst in Malignant dataset
range_perimeter_worst <- range(perimeter_Malignant$perimeter_worst)
print(range_perimeter_worst)

#mean of perimeter_worst in Malignant dataset
mean_perimeter_worst <- mean(perimeter_Malignant$perimeter_worst)
print(mean_perimeter_worst)

#Standard deviation of perimeter_worst in Malignant dataset
sd_perimeter_worst <- sd(perimeter_Malignant$perimeter_worst)
print(sd_perimeter_worst)

#median of perimeter_worst in Malignant dataset
median_perimeter_worst <- median(perimeter_Malignant$perimeter_worst)
print(median_perimeter_worst)
```


**Q3. Graphing:** Make a graph where it makes sense to customize the alpha transparency.

```{r}
#Loadding the package
library(ggplot2)

#Producing a new dataset only contain perimeter data called perimeter_dataset for both patients: malignant and benign
perimeter_dataset <- dataset %>%  
  select(diagnosis, perimeter_mean, perimeter_se, perimeter_mean_se, perimeter_worst)
print(perimeter_dataset)

# based on the description of the main data set(cancer_sample), perimeter_worst is "Worst" or largest perimeter of nuclei present in sample image.
#plot: this analysis help us to have better idea to see the perimeter_worst (largest) difference between malignant and benign samples.
plot_Q3 <- ggplot(perimeter_dataset, aes(x = diagnosis, y = perimeter_worst, color = diagnosis)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(alpha = perimeter_worst)) +
  labs(
    title = "largest (Worst) Perimeter by Diagnosis",
    x = "Diagnosis",
    y = "largest (Worst) Perimeter of nuclei"
  )+
  theme_minimal()
print(plot_Q3)
```

##### Question 4. In _malignant_ samples, is there any association between the **largest compactness** of nuclei and the **largest smoothness** of nuclei?
**Q4.Summarizing:** Create a categorical variable with 3 or more groups from an existing numerical variable. You can use this new variable in the other tasks! An example: age in years into “child, teen, adult, senior”.

```{r}
Malignant

# based on the description of the main dataset(cancer_sample), compactness_worst and smoothness_worst are "Worst" or largest compactness and "Worst" or largest smoothness of nuclei present in sample image, respectively.
# for answering question 4, I would like to have a new dataset only focus on "Worst" variables in malignant patients since help me to address this question (Q4) better.

Malignant_worst_data <- Malignant %>%
  select(
    ID,
    diagnosis,
    radius_worst,
    texture_worst,
    perimeter_worst,
    area_worst,
    smoothness_worst,
    compactness_worst,
    concavity_worst,
    concave_points_worst,
    symmetry_worst,
    fractal_dimension_worst) %>%
  filter(diagnosis == "Malignant")
print(Malignant_worst_data)

# I would like to create four groups within the variable "smoothness_worst" based on its quartiles; this sorting helps me to have better view regaring the relationship between smoothness_worst and compactness_worst in only malignant samples.



# quartile 1 (First Quartile) of smoothness_worst in malignant samples
Q1 <- quantile(Malignant_worst_data$smoothness_worst, probs = 0.25)
print(Q1)

#Median or Q2 of smoothness_worst in malignant samples
Q2 <- median(Malignant_worst_data$smoothness_worst)
print(Q2)

# quartile 3 (Third Quartile) of smoothness_worst in malignant samples
Q3 <- quantile(Malignant_worst_data$smoothness_worst, probs = 0.75)
print(Q3)


# make new dataset Create a categorical variable from smoothness_worst
New_Malignant_worst_data <- Malignant_worst_data %>% 
  mutate(smoothness_worst_Catego = case_when(
    smoothness_worst <= Q1 ~ "Group 1",  # Group 1 is equal and less than Q1 of smoothness_worst
    smoothness_worst > Q1 & smoothness_worst <= Q2 ~ "Group 2",  # Group2 is between more than Q1 and equal and less than median(Q2) of smoothness_worst
    smoothness_worst > Q2 & smoothness_worst <= Q3 ~ "Group 3",   # Group3 is between more than Q2 (median) and equal and less than Q3 of smoothness_worst.
    smoothness_worst > Q3 ~ "Group 4"   # Group4 is more than Q3 of smoothness_worst.
  ))
print(New_Malignant_worst_data)

```

**Q4. Graphing:** Create a graph that has at least two geom layers.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

#plot: this analysis help us to have better idea to see relationship between compactness_worst and smoothness_worst in malignant samples.
# in this plot: I grouped Largest (Worst) smoothness in malignant patients to four groups based on the quartiles as shown below.
#Group 1: minimum to and equal first quartile of data [M, Q1] include both minimum and  first quartile
#Group 2: first quartile to and equal median (Q1, Median] include median and not quartile one
#Group 3: median to and equal third quartile (Median, Q3] include quartile 3 and not median
#Group 4: third quartile to and equal maximum (Q3, Maximum] include maximum and not quartile 3.

plot_Q4 <- ggplot(New_Malignant_worst_data, aes(x = smoothness_worst_Catego, y = compactness_worst, color = smoothness_worst_Catego)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", alpha = 0.01, width = 0.85) + 
  labs(
    title = "Largest (Worst) Compactness by Largest (Worst) Smoothness in Malignant",
    x = "Largest (Worst) smoothness",
    y = "Largest (Worst) Compactness of nuclei"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
print(plot_Q4)

```


### 1.3 (2 points)

Based on the operations that you've completed, how much closer are you to answering your research questions? Think about what aspects of your research questions remain unclear. Can your research questions be refined, now that you've investigated your data a bit more? Which research questions are yielding interesting results?

<!------------------------- Write your answer here ---------------------------->
Based on the operations that I've completed, I have made significant progress in addressing my research questions. The data analysis and visualization tasks have provided valuable insights and a better understanding of the research questions; the work completed so far has brought me closer to the research objectives, which is finding the difference between **malignant** patients and **benign** patients in the aforementioned variables in the questions.

After delving into the data, several aspects of my research questions still appear unclear. It is evident that further refinement is necessary to effectively address these uncertainties. For example, I need to focus more on the **malignant** patients and investigate the association between variables containing _'Worst'_ or the largest values.

The most interesting results to me; it appears that not only do malignant patients exhibit higher values for both perimeter and compactness of nuclei compared to benign patients, but this difference is more pronounced when considering the _'Worst'_ or largest perimeter of nuclei among these two types of patients (**Malignant** vs **Benign**) and also there might be association between difference variables within a diagnosis group in particular **malignant** patients.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

# Task 2: Tidy your data 

In this task, we will do several exercises to reshape our data. The goal here is to understand how to do this reshaping with the `tidyr` package.

A reminder of the definition of *tidy* data:

-   Each row is an **observation**
-   Each column is a **variable**
-   Each cell is a **value**

### 2.1 (2 points)

Based on the definition above, can you identify if your data is tidy or untidy? Go through all your columns, or if you have \>8 variables, just pick 8, and explain whether the data is untidy or tidy.

<!--------------------------- Start your work below --------------------------->
```{r}
cancer_sample
First_8_variables <- cancer_sample[, 1:8]
print(First_8_variables)
```
Based on _**the first 8 variables**_ of data set (cancer_sample), this dataset is _tidy_ because:

>1. Each variable is in its own column: The data is structured so that each attribute occupies a dedicated column.

>2. Each row represents a unique observation: Every row contains distinct and self-contained information.

>3. Different types of data are organized into separate tables: The dataset is organized in a way that keeps various observational units in their own clearly defined tables.

These characteristics make the dataset clear, organized, and suitable for easy analysis and manipulation.


<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

### 2.2 (4 points)

Now, if your data is tidy, untidy it! Then, tidy it back to it's original state.

If your data is untidy, then tidy it! Then, untidy it back to it's original state.

Be sure to explain your reasoning for this task. Show us the "before" and "after".

<!--------------------------- Start your work below --------------------------->
#### make untidy the dataset by makeing wider

```{r}
library(tidyr)
# since I considered the first 8 variables of the dataset for tidy/untidy assessment, I am going to work on the first 8 variables of the dataset.
First_8_variables

# Make untidy the data by making wider the dataset (First_8_variables) through adding malignant and benign to each variables.
After <- First_8_variables %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = diagnosis, values_from = radius_mean:compactness_mean)
print(After)


# tidy bake the untidy dataset(After) by make it longer and having the diagnosis column again.

Before <- After %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -ID,
    names_to = c(".value", "diagnosis"),
    names_sep = "n_"
  ) %>%
  na.omit()
print(Before)

  

```



<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->


### 2.3 (4 points)

Now, you should be more familiar with your data, and also have made progress in answering your research questions. Based on your interest, and your analyses, pick 2 of the 4 research questions to continue your analysis in the remaining tasks:

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->

1.  Is there a difference in the **mean perimeter** of nuclei present in a sample image between _malignant_ diagnosis samples and _benign_ diagnosis samples?
2.  Do _malignant samples_ have the **largest perimeter** of nuclei present in the sample image compared to the _benign_ samples?

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Explain your decision for choosing the above two research questions.

<!--------------------------- Start your work below --------------------------->
According to this well-known [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927776519305466) in field of breast cancer, Perimeter of nuclei present in a sample image is one of the features that can be used to diagnose breast cancer.  The perimeter mean is the average length of the boundary of the nuclei of cells present in the sample image. The perimeter mean is one of the features that can be used to differentiate between malignant and benign tumors. Therefore, I am wondering the perimeter mean or largest (Worse) perimeter can be used as a diagnostic feature to differentiate between **malignant** and **benign tumors**.![](https://greaterorlandogi.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GITRP4-min-scaled.jpg)
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Now, try to choose a version of your data that you think will be appropriate to answer these 2 questions. Use between 4 and 8 functions that we've covered so far (i.e. by filtering, cleaning, tidy'ing, dropping irrelevant columns, etc.).

(If it makes more sense, then you can make/pick two versions of your data, one for each research question.) 

<!--------------------------- Start your work below --------------------------->
```{r}
cancer_sample

# modifying the dataset in order to have more accurate variables.

dataset <- cancer_sample %>%
  mutate(
    radius_mean_se = radius_mean + radius_se,
    texture_mean_se = texture_mean + texture_se,
    perimeter_mean_se = perimeter_mean + perimeter_se,
    area_mean_se = area_mean + area_se,
    smoothness_mean_se = smoothness_mean + smoothness_se,
    compactness_mean_se = compactness_mean + compactness_se,
    concavity_mean_se = concavity_mean + concavity_se,
    concave_point_mean_se = concave_points_mean + concave_points_se,
    symmetry_mean_se = symmetry_mean + symmetry_se,
    fractal_dimension_mean_se = fractal_dimension_mean + fractal_dimension_se) %>%
  mutate(diagnosis = ifelse(diagnosis == "B", "Benign", ifelse(diagnosis == "M", "Malignant", diagnosis)))
print(dataset)



#Producing a new dataset only contain perimeter data called perimeter_dataset because this dataset responses to two aforementioned questions in the last section.
perimeter_dataset_2 <- dataset %>%  
  select(diagnosis, perimeter_mean_se, perimeter_worst) %>%
  arrange(desc(diagnosis))
print(perimeter_dataset_2)


```

# Task 3: Modelling

## 3.0 (no points)

Pick a research question from 1.2, and pick a variable of interest (we'll call it "Y") that's relevant to the research question. Indicate these.

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->

**Research Question**: Is there a difference in the **mean perimeter** of nuclei present in a sample image between _malignant_ diagnosis samples and _benign_ diagnosis samples?

**Variable of interest**: perimeter_mean_se

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## 3.1 (3 points)

Fit a model or run a hypothesis test that provides insight on this variable with respect to the research question. Store the model object as a variable, and print its output to screen. We'll omit having to justify your choice, because we don't expect you to know about model specifics in STAT 545.

-   **Note**: It's OK if you don't know how these models/tests work. Here are some examples of things you can do here, but the sky's the limit.

    -   You could fit a model that makes predictions on Y using another variable, by using the `lm()` function.
    -   You could test whether the mean of Y equals 0 using `t.test()`, or maybe the mean across two groups are different using `t.test()`, or maybe the mean across multiple groups are different using `anova()` (you may have to pivot your data for the latter two).
    -   You could use `lm()` to test for significance of regression coefficients.

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->
```{r}
#fitting the model
mini_project_lm <- lm(perimeter_mean_se ~ diagnosis, data = perimeter_dataset_2)
print(mini_project_lm)

```

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## 3.2 (3 points)

Produce something relevant from your fitted model: either predictions on Y, or a single value like a regression coefficient or a p-value.

-   Be sure to indicate in writing what you chose to produce.
-   Your code should either output a tibble (in which case you should indicate the column that contains the thing you're looking for), or the thing you're looking for itself.
-   Obtain your results using the `broom` package if possible. If your model is not compatible with the broom function you're needing, then you can obtain your results by some other means, but first indicate which broom function is not compatible.

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->
```{r}
# load  the package
library(broom)
# using tidy for statistical information (regression coefficients)
tidy(mini_project_lm)

#In order to make prediction  on each row
augment(mini_project_lm)

# using glance in order to summary the statistical analysis on whole model
glance(mini_project_lm)


```

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

# Task 4: Reading and writing data

Get set up for this exercise by making a folder called `output` in the top level of your project folder / repository. You'll be saving things there.

## 4.1 (3 points)

Take a summary table that you made from Task 1, and write it as a csv file in your `output` folder. Use the `here::here()` function.

-   **Robustness criteria**: You should be able to move your Mini Project repository / project folder to some other location on your computer, or move this very Rmd file to another location within your project repository / folder, and your code should still work.
-   **Reproducibility criteria**: You should be able to delete the csv file, and remake it simply by knitting this Rmd file.

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->
```{r}
# loading packages
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
# writing the dataset in the folder
output <- here("output/Malignant_worst_data.csv")
write_csv(Malignant_worst_data, output)


```

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## 4.2 (3 points)

Write your model object from Task 3 to an R binary file (an RDS), and load it again. Be sure to save the binary file in your `output` folder. Use the functions `saveRDS()` and `readRDS()`.

-   The same robustness and reproducibility criteria as in 4.1 apply here.

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->
```{r}
#loading the package
library(here)
rds_location <- here("output/mini_project_lm.rds")

#write the model by aveRDS() function
saveRDS(mini_project_lm, rds_location)

#loading the model by readRDS() function

readRDS(rds_location)


```

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

# Overall Reproducibility/Cleanliness/Coherence Checklist 

Here are the criteria we're looking for.

## Coherence (0.5 points)

The document should read sensibly from top to bottom, with no major continuity errors. 

The README file should still satisfy the criteria from the last milestone, i.e. it has been updated to match the changes to the repository made in this milestone. 

## File and folder structure (1 points)

You should have at least three folders in the top level of your repository: one for each milestone, and one output folder. If there are any other folders, these are explained in the main README.

Each milestone document is contained in its respective folder, and nowhere else.

Every level-1 folder (that is, the ones stored in the top level, like "Milestone1" and "output") has a `README` file, explaining in a sentence or two what is in the folder, in plain language (it's enough to say something like "This folder contains the source for Milestone 1").

## Output (1 point)

All output is recent and relevant:

-   All Rmd files have been `knit`ted to their output md files. 
-   All knitted md files are viewable without errors on Github. Examples of errors: Missing plots, "Sorry about that, but we can't show files that are this big right now" messages, error messages from broken R code
-   All of these output files are up-to-date -- that is, they haven't fallen behind after the source (Rmd) files have been updated.
-   There should be no relic output files. For example, if you were knitting an Rmd to html, but then changed the output to be only a markdown file, then the html file is a relic and should be deleted.

Our recommendation: delete all output files, and re-knit each milestone's Rmd file, so that everything is up to date and relevant.
